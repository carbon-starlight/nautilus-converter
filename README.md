# Convert files directly from GNOME Files

This script is a particial implementation of a [feature request](https://discourse.gnome.org/t/feature-request-add-an-option-to-quickly-convert-formats-right-from-files/) to make a file converter built-in in GNOME Files, aka Nautilus. While not a substitude for this function, it allows for conversion in a not much less inconvenient manner.

I decided to go along Nautilius and make use of the same license (except not the “only” version). will consider switching to permissive if you will convince me it would be beneficial.
